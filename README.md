My name is <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61030079/88273604-bb90fe80-ccda-11ea-84bf-ce87118c0ab9.gif" height="14"/> <strong>Arthur</strong>, as an engineer I've always been interested in things, especially how they work.

As an architect, the <strong>functionality</strong> and <strong>aesthetics</strong> of the projects are most important to me.
The <strong>clean code</strong> and <strong>excellent</strong> result is an ideal to which I strive. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61030079/88274412-f7789380-ccdb-11ea-84fa-355bfb6dc335.gif" height="16"/>
