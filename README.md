My name is <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61030079/88273604-bb90fe80-ccda-11ea-84bf-ce87118c0ab9.gif" height="14"/> <strong>Arthur</strong>, as an engineer I've always been interested in things, especially how they work.
What has been the most fascinating for me was how complex mechanism occur in seemingly such simple objects.

As an architect, the <strong>functionality</strong> and <strong>aesthetics</strong> of the projects are most important to me.
The <strong>clean code</strong> and <strong>excellent result</strong> is an ideal to which I strive. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61030079/88274412-f7789380-ccdb-11ea-84fa-355bfb6dc335.gif" height="16"/>
