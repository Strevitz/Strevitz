My name is ![PACMAN](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgifer.com%2Fen%2Fgifs%2Fpac-man&psig=AOvVaw15Vd5eH_Bl-hmGmjswqBuc&ust=1595583893056000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCNCmiryL4-oCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD) Arthur, as an engineer I've always been interested in things, especially how they work.
What has been the most fascinating for me was how complex mechanism occur in seemingly such simple objects.

As an architect, the functionality and aesthetics of the projects are most important to me.
The pure code and excellent result is an ideal to which I strive.
